# poller
A simple Unreal Tournament Discord bot for voting and selecting game servers. <br /> 

This bot requires node.js to run. <br />

The current way to trigger the bot is set to type !voteserver but can be set to any keyword with or without the prefix.
After a 60 second time delay the poll will close and the bot will send a query request for the predefined server attributed to the region selected.

You need to give yourself the role "Poller" to be able to manage the bot. <br />

Bot Commands: <br />
<br />
!listvotes (shows vote servers loaded) <br /> 
!votelimit number (sets the time for the vote in seconds) <br />
!delvote number (using number from !listvotes) <br />
!addvote name flag address <br />
example !addvote ip4 - USA ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ unreal://us2.gibblets.com:7777?password=gibblets2023 <br />
<br />
Use Unicode for Flags <br />
