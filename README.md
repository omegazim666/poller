# poller
A simple Unreal Tournament Discord bot for voting and selecting game servers. <br /> 

This bot requires node.js to run. <br />

The current way to trigger the bot is set to type !voteserver but can be set to any keyword with or without the prefix.
After a 60 second time delay the poll will close and the bot will send a query request for the predefined server attributed to the region selected.

You need to give yourself the role "Poller" to be able to manage the bot. <br />
